# How I Got Into Pokémon Card Collecting

Pokémon card collecting is one of those hobbies that I've thought about, on and off, for years. The TCG has been background noise for as long as I've been into Pokémon but it's only recently started to really click with me.

## Post-Pokémania

Like any kid growing up in the 90's, I was not immune to Pokémania. I don't know if the phenomenon hit the UK as hard as it did the US, but I remember begging my parents for a Game Boy Pocket and a copy of Pokémon Red, making sure I got up early enough to watch the anime on Saturday morning, learning to draw by copying pictures of my favourite Pokémon — yet trading cards didn't seem to be a part of that. I was certainly aware of them, but I have zero memory of ever receiving a booster pack.

Granted, my memory is exedingly bad.

It wasn't until the release of **Pokémon Trading Card Game** for the Game Boy Color in 2000 that I started to take an interest. I was fascinated by this little mainline adjacent title. The turn based gameplay was familiar to me but the random chance of card draws and coin flips, the lack of a fully fleshed out overworld, and the sprites that were so similar yet so different to the mainline games made a bizarre yet enticing package. Unfortunately the game was maybe a bit _too_ different for me, I never got very far and the release of Pokémon Gold and Silver soon afterwards took up all of my attention.

Nonetheless, a seed had been planted.

It was around the release of Gold and Silver that I started taking an interest in the physical cards. I didn't have much concept of collecting back then but I knew it was a _game_ and I wanted to play.

Problem was I didn't have anyone to play _with_.

The initial hype around the series was starting to die down and I was pretty shy as a child. The few friends I did have weren't really into video games or collectable monsters. I was still determined, and if none of my friends were interested I would **make** them interested! I looked up how to make a deck and bought the cards required, entirely in singles, from one of the few websites selling them at the time. I made two decks, one for me and one for a friend of mine. The construction was... questionable, I'm pretty sure I included a stage one Pokémon in my friend's deck without the basic Pokémon to evolve it. Regardless I put the deck together, making sure the cards were in a very specific order, and wrote up a tutorial just like the GBC game so I could teach my friend how to play.

I don't think she got into it, but I still insisted on having a match whenever I was at her house.

## Intermission

After middle school we started to drift apart. Our parents were still friends, so I would see her occasionally, but there were no more day-to-day interactions at school. I also started to drift away from Pokémon cards now that I had no one the play with. I'm still not sure what happened to my old deck, likely given away or lost in a clear out.

It was around the Fire Red and Leaf Green era, one of my high-school friends mentioned getting a booster pack of Pokémon cards (for fun, I don't think they played the game) and I remember being surprised cards were still being made. Of course my curiosity got the better of me and I couldn't help buying the occasional pack from my local Woolworths. I wasn't planning on getting back into the game, it was just to see what I could get. Nothing interesting, none of my favourite Pokémon at least.

## Toy Shop Era

My next run in with the Pokémon card game wouldn't be until much, _much_ later. Until after I graduated university and started working at a toy shop. Of course Pokémon cards were among the variable treasure trove of playthings. I'd learned it wasn't just booster packs anymore either, products such as promotional blisters and elite trainer boxes had also found their way into the mix.

Incidentially, this was also the summer of the world cup and all of my coworkers decided to use their employee discounts on collectible football stickers. I also got caught up in the excitement, despite not being a footie fan, and spent the last half of the year trading with people online and exchanging stickers in the mail.

With nothing else to spend my employee discount on, I decided that this would finally be the time I'd get into Pokémon cards! I bought the **Crimson Invasion** elite trainer box as well as various blisters and boosters whenever the mood struck. It was so interesting to see how the cards themselves had changed — no longer confined to their small frames, rarer and more powerful Pokémon would envelop the entire card with gorgeous, dynamic artwork. Secret rares and full arts also found their ways into the occasional lucky booster. As exciting as it was, I had no direction besides buying products and opening packs. I had a binder to store my aquisitions but I stored _everything_, cramming duplicates into the same binder slot until the plastic became loose.

With so many cards it seemed a waste not to get back into the game, so I figured I'd give it another shot. In the years between high school and university I'd moved with my parents to a different part of the country, and the nearby city had a games shop that hosted Pokémon TCG nights. With my newfound interest in Pokémon cards I learned that one of my coworkers was also into the game. We weren't particularly close but it was reassuring to know that there was a familiar face about when I went to observe one of the game nights. It was busier than I expected, but it was good to talk with my coworker and his friends about the game and how it compared to other TCGs. Online it was easy to research how to play and deck making for beginners. In the end I bought a pre-made deck to modify.

Know-how is one thing but playing is another matter and unfortunately that would be the nail in the coffin for this particular era.

The Pokémon TCG nights were split into casual and competative play. As a beginner I figured the casual night would suit me best, unfortunately there was no appetite for casual play. My coworker and his friends nowhere to be seen, it was just me and a couple of school kids. We still played of course, I won one came and lost another, but without any familiar faces my nerves got the better of me an my hands would not stop shaking. In the end, the fun I got from playing wasn't worth the fear that went with it. I ended up quitting at the toy shop to start training for a web development job and with no employee discount to make use of there was just no reason to buy cards anymore.

## Now

I moved out of my parents house and into my own apartment the day the UK went into national lockdown. The NFT craze came and went, pinging the part of my brain that had grown to love collectibles — thankfully I didn't know a thing about cryptocurrency. Every so often I would think about collecting football stickers again but I really have no interest in the sport. Three years go by, and I agree to buy a house with a friend of mine. Around this time I notice a lot of Giratina themed products in shop windows, no doubt because of the release of **Pokémon Legends Arceus**. A small comic shop I often walked past had the **Lost Origin** elite trainer box in the window, which I bought as a treat for getting all the mortgage paperwork sorted. Of course I'm after the cool Giratina cards! It's on the packaging after all! Not much luck in most of the booster packs, but the final one grants me a **Giratina V** card! Only the standard print, but of course I'm ecstatic.

I also saw a lot of the Gallade/Rotom/Giratina promotional tins around, but only with the Gallade and Rotom promo cards. Giratina was nowhere to be found. Just by chance I happened to spy it at a stationary shop, of all places, while I was buying backing board for a cross-stich project.

With the move iminent, I completely forgot to unwrap it.

Somehow we exchanged contracts and moved in with a manageable amount of stress, althought I learned we both live very separate lives. My new job is entirely remote and I start feeling lonlier than I ever did during covid.

So I did what any self-respecting adult would do and became a furry.

The internet had changed a lot since the Pokémon forums I hung out on as a teen and I still struggle to make friends online, it was honestly a godsend when I found there was an in-person meetup nearby. Having a time and space to meet other people face to face made all the difference! Natually Pokémon and furries go hand in hand. In fact the reason I got interested in the furry fandom in the first place was through my exposure through the Pokémon fandom.

One of the people I met there happened to be a fan of the card game.

They mentioned bringing along their cards so I dug out my old deck from my toy shop days, even though it was several rotations out of play. They supervised a match between me and another person, giving advice and reminding me of the rules — I realised that having that casual mentoring was what I'd been missing all those years ago. It was fun! I didn't have to worry about being a beginner, that much was expected, and it felt good to finally give the deck I'd made another go.

This was around the time **Temporal Forces** released, so when I was looking up information on the card game online of course I came across a lot of content about collecting. I'd toyed with the idea of collecting Giratina cards before, but with a newfound interest in the game I felt the itch to collect again.

Digging out the cards I'd bought just before I moved house, I finally unwrapped my Giratina promo tin.
